## Preprocessing methods for raw data in single-cell analysis

### 1. Quality Control and Filtering

-   This involves removing low quality cells or genes that have low expression or too many zeroes.

```
import scanpy as sc

# Load data into a AnnData object
adata = sc.read(filename)

# Quality control and filtering
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=200) # remove cells with fewer than 200 genes detected
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=3) # remove genes detected in fewer than 3 cells
```

### 2. Feature selection

-   Choosing a subset of genes that are most informative and removing those that are not.

```
# Identify highly variable genes
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata)

# Subset data to include only highly variable genes
adata = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']]
```

### 3. Normalization

-   This involves scaling the expression values of cells to account for differences in sequencing depth and technical variation.

```
# Normalize data
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata, target_sum=1e4) # normalize total counts to 10,000 per cell
sc.pp.log1p(adata) # log-transform data
```

### 4. Batch Correction

-   This involves removing batch effects that may arise from processing cells in different batches or at different times.

```
# Correct for batch effects
sc.pp.combat(adata, key='batch') # correct for batch effects using ComBat
```

### 5. Dimension Reduction

-   This involves reducing the high-dimensional gene expression data to a lower-dimensional space for visualization and clustering.

```
# Perform dimensionality reduction
sc.tl.pca(adata) # compute principal components
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=10) # compute neighborhood graph
sc.tl.umap(adata) # compute UMAP projection
```

### 6. Cell Type Identification

-   This involves identifying cell types based on the expression of known marker genes or clustering cells based on their similarity in gene expression.

```
# Identify cell types
sc.tl.leiden(adata) # cluster cells based on gene expression similarity using Leiden algorithm
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='t-test') # identify marker genes for each cluster
```
